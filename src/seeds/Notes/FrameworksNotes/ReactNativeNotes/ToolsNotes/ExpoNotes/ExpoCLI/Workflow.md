## Introduction to the Managed Workflow

The <span class="emphasis">Managed Workflow</span> is Expo's simplified development model where much of the underlying configuration is abstracted away.

Key Highlights:
- Focus on writing React Native code without worrying about native Android or iOS code.
- Expo manages all the native configuration, updates, and builds for you.
- Ideal for rapid development and prototyping.

---

### Benefits of the Managed Workflow

**Speed and Simplicity**
- No need to configure Android Studio or Xcode manually.
- Immediate access to Expo‚Äôs APIs (camera, notifications, sensors, etc.).

**Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates**
- Push code updates to your app without resubmitting to app stores.
- Fix bugs or release new features instantly.

**Unified Development**
- Develop apps simultaneously for both iOS and Android using a single codebase.

**Expo Go App**
- Preview your app instantly on a real device via QR code scanning.

---

### Typical Workflow in Managed Mode

- Install Expo CLI globally:

```shell
npm install -g expo-cli
```

- Create a new project:

```shell
expo init MyNewApp
```

- Start the development server:

```shell
cd MyNewApp
npm start
```

- Scan the QR code using the <span class="emphasis">Expo Go</span> app on your iOS or Android device.

‚úÖ You can immediately see your project running without compiling native code.

---

### Running Your App on Simulators or Physical Devices

Once you have started the Expo development server, you have several ways to view and test your app depending on your setup.

‚úÖ **Available Options:**

- <span class="emphasis">Android Emulator</span> (AVD) ‚Äî for testing on virtual Android devices.
- <span class="emphasis">iOS Simulator</span> ‚Äî for testing on virtual iOS devices (Mac only).
- <span class="emphasis">Expo Go App</span> ‚Äî for testing on real Android and iOS devices using a QR code.

### Launching the App After Starting the Metro Bundler

After running <span class="codeSnip">npm start</span> in your project folder, the Metro Bundler will open. You can use keyboard shortcuts to launch your app:

‚úÖ **Keyboard Shortcuts:**

- Press <span class="emphasis">a</span> to open the app on an Android emulator.
- Press <span class="emphasis">i</span> to open the app on an iOS simulator (Mac only).
- Press <span class="emphasis">w</span> to open the app in a web browser.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The <span class="emphasis">iOS Simulator</span> option requires a Mac with <span class="emphasis">Xcode</span> installed. This option is not available on Windows machines.

---

### Using Expo Go on Physical Devices

If you prefer testing on a real device:

1. Install the <span class="emphasis">Expo Go</span> app:
   - üì± **iOS**: Available on the App Store.
   - üì± **Android**: Available on Google Play.

2. Start the Metro Bundler:

```shell
npm start
```

3. A QR code will appear in your terminal or Expo DevTools.

4. Open the <span class="emphasis">Expo Go</span> app on your device and use it to scan the QR code.

‚úÖ Your app will open instantly on your physical device.

Depending on your operating system and development environment, Expo CLI gives you flexible options to run your app ‚Äî on emulators, simulators, or real devices ‚Äî with minimal configuration.

---

### Limitations of the Managed Workflow

‚ö†Ô∏è **Access to Custom Native Code**
- If you need custom native modules that Expo doesn‚Äôt provide, you‚Äôll have to eject.

‚ö†Ô∏è **App Size**
- Managed apps tend to have larger initial binary sizes compared to bare React Native projects.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Advanced Native Features**
- Some low-level platform customizations are not possible without ejecting.

---

### Ejecting to Bare Workflow

If you outgrow the Managed Workflow, Expo provides an ejecting option:

```shell
expo eject
```

‚úÖ This will generate native Android and iOS folders, transitioning you to a standard React Native project.

---

‚úÖ **Conclusion**

The <span class="emphasis">Managed Workflow</span> is perfect for quick iterations, MVPs, and apps that primarily use Expo-supported APIs.

It offers a very low barrier to entry while still giving you the option to eject if more advanced functionality is needed down the line.
