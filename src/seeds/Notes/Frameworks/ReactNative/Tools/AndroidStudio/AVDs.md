## Creating Virtual Devices (AVDs) in Android Studio

---

### Introduction to Android Emulators (for React Native)

Android Studio’s AVD Manager allows you to create virtual Android devices for testing React Native apps without a physical device.

- Virtual devices allow developers to emulate different screen sizes, Android versions, and hardware profiles.

---

### Accessing AVD Manager

Once Android Studio is installed and configured:

- Open Android Studio.
- Navigate to the **More Actions** dropdown on the welcome screen.
- Select **Virtual Device Manager**.

From here, you can create, manage, and run virtual devices.

---

### Creating a New Virtual Device

1. Click on **Create Virtual Device**.
2. Choose a device profile (e.g., Pixel 6, Nexus 5X) depending on the screen size and resolution you want to simulate.
3. Click **Next**.

---

### Selecting a System Image

- Pick an Android version (e.g., Android 13, Android 14) based on your testing needs.
- Download the system image if it’s not already installed.
- Click **Next**.

---

### Configuring the Virtual Device

- Keep the default settings unless specific configuration changes are needed (like orientation, memory, or storage).
- Name your virtual device.
- Click **Finish** to create the device.

The AVD will now appear in your **Virtual Device Manager** list.

---

### Running the Virtual Device

- In **Virtual Device Manager**, locate your new device.
- Click the **Play** ▶️ button to launch the emulator.

The emulator acts like a real Android device, enabling you to test your React Native apps without connecting physical hardware.

### Launching Your App on the Emulator with Expo

Once your Android Virtual Device (AVD) is running, you can launch your React Native app directly onto it using Expo CLI.

**Steps to Launch:**

1. Open your project folder in a terminal.
2. Start the Expo development server:

```shell
npm start
```

3. After the Metro Bundler opens, press:

- <span class="emphasis">a</span> to launch the app on your running Android emulator.

Expo CLI will automatically detect the emulator and install the app onto it without requiring a physical device.

---

### Troubleshooting Emulator Issues

- **Emulator Not Detected?**
  - Ensure the AVD is running before you start the Metro Bundler.
  - Restart the emulator if the Metro Bundler cannot detect it.

- **Metro Bundler Not Responding?**
  - Close and restart both the emulator and the Metro Bundler.
  - Verify that no other processes are using the ports needed by Expo.

### Quick Tip

If you prefer to test on a real device instead of an emulator, you can install the <span class="emphasis">Expo Go</span> app on your Android device and scan the QR code generated by the Metro Bundler.

### Tips for Using AVDs

- **Performance**: Enable hardware acceleration (Intel HAXM or Hypervisor Framework) for better performance.
- **Snapshots**: Use quick boot snapshots for faster emulator startup.
- **Multiple Devices**: You can run multiple virtual devices simultaneously to test various form factors and Android versions.
