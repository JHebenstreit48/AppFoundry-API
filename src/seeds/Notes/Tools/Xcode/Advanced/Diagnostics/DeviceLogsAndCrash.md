# Device Logs & Crash Reports

## Live Logs
Use the Devices window to stream logs from a connected device or the simulator. Filter by process to focus on your app.

## Crash Reports
Collect crash logs from devices or the organizer. To symbolicate, ensure your dSYM files match the app build.

## Tips
- Reproduce with Debug builds for clearer logs
- Add contextual logging in your app at key flows
- Keep dSYM files for all released builds
